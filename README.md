Insurance Claim Prediction

 Objectives:
Predict medical insurance claim amounts using personal and health-related data such as age, BMI, and smoking status.

 Approach:
- Used the Linear Regression algorithm.
- Explored data relationships through scatter plots and boxplots.
- Encoded categorical features and trained a predictive model.
- Evaluated performance using MAE and RMSE.

Results & Insights:
- Smoker status and BMI were strongly correlated with higher claim costs.
- The Linear Regression model gave a good baseline with:
  - **MAE**: 4910.91
  - **RMSE**: 6234.64
